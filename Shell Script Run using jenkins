SSH Key Setup: Set up SSH keys for password less authentication

1.	Use the ssh-keygen command to create a new SSH key pair

ssh-keygen
Press Enter to accept the default file location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).
Optionally, enter a passphrase for added security, or press Enter twice for no passphrase

2.	Copy the Public Key to the Remote Server
ssh-copy-id root@192.168.1.143
Enter the password for the remote server when prompted.

3.	Log in to the remote server
ssh root@192.168.1.143
Ensure the ~/.ssh directory and authorized_keys file have the correct permissions:
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

C.	Steps to Run the Shell Script on a Remote Server

1.	Install SSH Plugin in Jenkins:

•	Go to Jenkins dashboard.
•	Click on "Manage Jenkins".
•	Select "Manage Plugins".
•	Go to the "Available" tab and search for "SSH".
•	Install "SSH Plugin" (or "SSH Agent Plugin" if needed).

2.	Configure SSH Credentials in Jenkins:

•	Go back to "Manage Jenkins".
•	Click on "Manage Credentials".
•	Select the appropriate domain (e.g., "Global credentials (unrestricted)").
•	Click "Add Credentials".
•	Select "SSH Username with private key" from the dropdown.
•	Username: Enter the username for SSH.
•	Private Key: Enter directly or use "Enter directly" to paste the key.
•	ID: Give an ID (optional but useful for reference).

3.	Create a New Jenkins Job:

•	Go back to Jenkins dashboard.
•	Click "New Item".
•	Enter a name for the job, select "Freestyle project", and click "OK".

4.	Configure the Job to Use SSH:

•	In the job configuration page, scroll down to the "Build" section.
•	Click on "Add build step" and select "Send files or execute commands over SSH" (provided by the SSH plugin).

5.	Add SSH Server Details:

•	Click "Add" to add a new SSH server.
•	Name: Give a name for the server.
•	Hostname: Enter the IP address or hostname of the remote server.
•	Username: Enter the username for SSH access.
•	Credentials: Select the credentials you added earlier.
•	Click "Test Configuration" to ensure Jenkins can connect to the remote server.

6.	Execute Shell Command on Remote Server:

•	Under "Exec command", enter the command to run your script on the remote server. For example: (Ensure the script path is correct and the script has executed permissions)
/path/to/your/remote/script.sh

7.	Save the Job Configuration:
•	Scroll down and click "Save".

8.	Build the Job:
•	On the job page, click "Build Now" to run the job immediately.

9.	Check Build Output:

•	Once the build is complete, you can view the console output by clicking on the build number in the "Build History" and then selecting "Console Output".

Troubleshooting
•	Connection Issues: Ensure that the Jenkins server can reach the remote server over SSH.
•	Permissions: Verify that the SSH user has permission to execute the script on the remote server.
•	Script Errors: Check the console output for any errors related to the script execution.
